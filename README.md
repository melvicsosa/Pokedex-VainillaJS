# Pokedex-Vainilla

#**Overview**

This project is a Pokedex device built using Vanilla JavaScript and CSS. It's a simple and user-friendly application that allows users to search for Pokémon and get detailed information about each one. The data is fetched from the PokeAPI, an extensive Pokémon API. One of the key features of this project is the implementation of the SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface, enabling the application to verbally announce the names and characteristics of each Pokémon.
